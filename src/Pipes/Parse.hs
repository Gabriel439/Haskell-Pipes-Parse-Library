{- $highlevel
    'input' provides a 'Producer' that streams from the underlying 'Producer'.

    Streaming from 'input' differs from streaming directly from the underlying
    'Producer' because any unused input is saved for later, as the following
    example illustrates:

> import Pipes
> import Pipes.Parse
> import qualified Pipes.Prelude as P
>
> parser1 :: (Show a) => StateT (Producer a IO r) IO ()
> parser1 = do
>     run $ for (input >-> P.take 2) (liftIO . print)
>     lift $ putStrLn "Intermission"
>     run $ for (input >-> P.take 2) (liftIO . print)

    The second pipeline continues where the first pipeline left off:

>>> evalStateT parser1 (each [1..])
1
2
Intermission
3
4

-}

-- | Stream from the underlying 'Producer'
input :: (Monad m) => Producer' a (StateT (Producer a m r) m) ()
input = loop
  where
    loop = do
        ma <- lift draw
        case ma of
            Nothing -> return ()
            Just a  -> do
                yield a
                loop
{-# INLINABLE input #-}

{- $isomorphisms
    You can use 'zoom' from @Control.Lens@ to segment the underlying 'Producer'
    and limit your sub-parser to to a subset of the input stream.

    You specify the subset you are interested in using an isomorphism like
    'splitsAt' or 'spans':

> -- A parser that prints all elements available to it
> printAll :: (Show a) => StateT (Producer a IO r) IO ()
> printAll = run $ for input (liftIO . print)
>
> parser2 :: StateT (Producer Int IO r) IO ()
> parser2 = do
>     -- Restrict the first sub-parser to elements less than 4
>     zoom (spans (< 4)) printAll
>
>     liftIO $ putStrLn "Intermission"
>
>     -- Restrict the second sub-parser to the next three elements
>     zoom (splitsAt 3) printAll

>>> evalStateT parser2 (each [1..])
1
2
3
Intermission
4
5
6

    This approach does not require you to push back any unused elements.  These
    isomorphisms correctly return unused input back to the surrounding
    parser when the 'zoom' completes.

> parser3 :: StateT (Producer Int IO r) IO ()
> parser3 = do
>     -- This 'zoom' block will return back the unused 3 when it is done
>     zoom (spans (< 4)) $ run $ for (input >-> P.take 2) (liftIO . print)
>
>     liftIO $ putStrLn "Intermission"
>
>     zoom (splitsAt 3) printAll

>>> evalStateT parser3 (each [1..])
1
2
Intermission
3
4
5

    Don't forget that you can nest 'zoom's or compose isomorphisms using ('.')
    to target substreams within substreams.

{-| 'splitUsing' is a utility function that library writers can use to build

    isomorphism.  See the source code to 'splitsAt' and 'spans' for example
    usage.
